2023-07-07, v12_1_3
===================

   ## changes
   - corrected operating conditions models of pmvaa, pmvab, dzati & dzcti to align with specification
   
   ## Known Issues
     1. In SOI processes, devices can exist in individual tubs which are isolated
        from each other. These tubs can have very different potentials, which may
        float up by several hundreds of volts with respect to global simulator
        ground (gnd!).
        Since some Operating Condition Check (OCC) & SOA models are limited in the
        number of terminals, it's not always possible to check terminal voltages
        against their individual bulk (e.g. csf3). In order to avoid ignoring the
        according conditions during OCC/SOA simulation at all, the check is done
        against global simulator GND, which is most conservative but can lead to
        pseudo violations which need to be waived by the designer in case.
     2. wrong (too conservative) current-related OCC results for Spectre (assert)
        & HSPICE (.biaschk) syntax in forward protection & Zener diodes and resistors
        when using mFactor>1
